Inside the large "trade_data_full.rar", you will find the large "trade_data_full.csv" with the original trade data that will be cleaned.

With the following "FINAL ALL countries ISO.csv" that represent the selected countries with its ISO code and the "ISO codes.csv" that contain the formal aspects ob both ISO and ISO-alpha3 codes for all countries, 

You shall need to: 

  0. Use Google Colab or Jupyter Lab and the "Final_cleaning_data.ipynb" must be uploaded and visible on the current workspace.
  1. Upload the previous mentioned "*.csv" on the current workspace.
  2. Run the import cell and all the group of functions
  3. Run the code group

You will get a "All Trade Links (year).csv" for every year across 2001 to 2019 which contain the cleaned bilater exchanges between countries.

Note: 
  Using Google Collab will take longer in uploading into its workspace the trade data.
  Althought file path should work for every current directory, Jupyter Lab may use a different format for file paths that you ought to change if that error arises. That is, changing to the correct path for read_csv functions.
